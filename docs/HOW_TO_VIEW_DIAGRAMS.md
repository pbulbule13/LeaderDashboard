# How to View the Mermaid Diagrams

The architecture diagrams are created using Mermaid syntax. Here are multiple ways to view them:

## Option 1: Open HTML File (RECOMMENDED - EASIEST)

**Just open this file in your browser:**
```
docs/architecture/DIAGRAMS.html
```

1. Navigate to: `C:\Users\pbkap\Downloads\EuronDownloads\Projects\LeaderDashboard\docs\architecture\DIAGRAMS.html`
2. Double-click the file or right-click and select "Open with" > Your preferred browser
3. All 13 diagrams will be beautifully rendered with interactive features

## Option 2: VS Code with Extension

1. **Install the Extension:**
   - Open VS Code
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open Extensions
   - Search for "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support"
   - Install the extension by Matt Bierner

2. **View the Diagrams:**
   - Open `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `DIAGRAMS.md`
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+V` to open Markdown Preview
   - The Mermaid diagrams will render automatically

## Option 3: Online Mermaid Live Editor

1. Go to https://mermaid.live/
2. Copy any Mermaid code block from `DIAGRAMS.md`
3. Paste it into the editor
4. The diagram will render instantly
5. You can export as PNG or SVG

## Option 4: GitHub (When Pushed)

If you push this to GitHub, the diagrams will render automatically when viewing the markdown files on GitHub.com.

## Option 5: Visual Studio Code Built-in Preview

Some newer versions of VS Code have built-in Mermaid support:

1. Open `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `DIAGRAMS.md`
2. Right-click in the editor
3. Select "Open Preview to the Side"
4. Diagrams may render automatically (depends on VS Code version)

## Troubleshooting

### Diagrams Not Showing in VS Code Preview?

**Solution:** Use the HTML file (`DIAGRAMS.html`) instead - it works in any browser without any extensions.

### Want to Export as Images?

1. Open `DIAGRAMS.html` in your browser
2. Right-click on any diagram
3. Select "Save image as..." or take a screenshot
4. Alternatively, use https://mermaid.live/ to export as SVG/PNG
